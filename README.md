# Quackers Front-End

This is the front-end (Rust) codebase for the online web game and virtual world, _Quackers._

_Note: To run locally this project locally you also need to have the [backend websocket](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/Quackers-Backend/) server running locally._

## Running the game

Running your game locally:

- Use `cargo run` to run a native dev build.
- Use [`trunk serve`](https://trunkrs.dev/) to run a web dev build.

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), this template comes with a [`.vscode/tasks.json`](./.vscode/tasks.json) file.

  <summary>Linux dependencies</summary>

If you are using Linux, make sure you take a look at Bevy's [Linux dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md).
Note that this template enables Wayland support, which requires additional dependencies as detailed in the link above.
Wayland is activated by using the `bevy/wayland` feature in the [`Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml).

<details>
    <summary>(Optional) Improve your compile times</summary>

[`.cargo/config_fast_builds.toml`](./.cargo/config_fast_builds.toml) contains documentation on how to set up your environment to improve compile times.
After you've fiddled with it, rename it to `.cargo/config.toml` to enable it.
